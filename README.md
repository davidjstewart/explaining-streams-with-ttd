# explaining-streams-with-ttd
Another example of using ttd to recreate and explain modern programming features (...and maybe some old features along the way).

This exercise is implemented in Java and will recreate stream functions such as map, filter and reduce.

I chose to use Java for this exercise because the equivalent JavaScript functions are simply too easy to recreate.
